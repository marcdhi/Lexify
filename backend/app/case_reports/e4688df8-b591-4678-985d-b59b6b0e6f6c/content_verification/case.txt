Jane Doe, a resident of Springfield, filed a case against "Silver Shield Investments," alleging that she was scammed into investing $50,000 in a fraudulent online investment scheme. The accused, operating under the alias "Michael Silver," promised guaranteed returns of 20% per month. The returns ceased after three months, and attempts to withdraw the principal amount were met with unresponsive communication. Investigators suspect the use of fake websites and untraceable cryptocurrency wallets.
