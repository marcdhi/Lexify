TechStart Solutions v. DataCorp International (2023) involves a $2 million software development contract breach. TechStart was hired to develop a machine learning algorithm for DataCorp, who then allegedly stole the technology and developed a competing product. Key evidence included matching source code (78% similarity), leaked confidential emails, and testimony from a former DataCorp employee admitting intentional replication. The court ruled in TechStart's favor, ordering DataCorp to pay $2.45M in damages and cease development of their competing product. The case highlighted the importance of protecting intellectual property in software development contracts.
